# OpenGL2

My second attempt at creating an OpenGL rendering engine

This project uses submodules, so don't forget to init/clone them too

## Building

This project uses CMake to build, so building is quite straightforward:  
Configure

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
```

Build

```sh
cmake --build
```

Or, for the impatient

```sh
./configure.sh
./build.sh
```

And

```sh
./run.sh
```
